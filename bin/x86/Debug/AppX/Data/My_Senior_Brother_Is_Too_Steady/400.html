</script><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Chapter 400 Empress Earth Seven Emotions</strong></p><p>After Li Changshou and the Lady of Earth came into contact with each other, Li Changshou left three days for himself.</p><p>In the past three days, his paper effigy had been running all over the place. He had made all the preparations he could.</p><p>The main body and the eight experts from the Dao Sect only did two things in the Lake of Tears.</p><p>He felt the power of the seven emotions through Little Grief.</p><p>He came up with a complete and detailed plan.</p><p>As for using some of his shallow knowledge from his previous life to mix the Dao runes of the Grand Pure One and the Yin-Yang Profound Truths to debate, he made Little Grief have more hope and less sadness…</p><p>A small demonstration was not worth mentioning.</p><p>At this moment, they were studying the real big matter!</p><div><div></div></div><p>The Great Daoist Master stood with his hands behind his back and said softly, “Let’s use the Taiji Painting. It’s safer.”</p><p>“How can a Connate Cardinal treasure be used here?” Zhao Gongming shook his head. “Senior Brother Xuan Du, why don’t you let me use the Sea-Calming Divine Pearl? The Sea-Calming Divine Pearl can also stabilize the universe and absorb everything.”</p><p>Perfected Taiyi pursed his lips slightly. “Water spraying. This is the first time I’ve seen a Connate numinous treasure that can spray water.”</p><p>Perfected Yu Ding, who had been silent all this while, said, “Senior Brothers, why don’t I help the Lady of Earth’s incarnation of grief over?” Little Grief, who was in front of the few of them, pursed her lips. She sat there and hugged herself and the pearl wrapped in black cloth. “I’ve already agreed to cooperate with you. Yet, I still have to watch you discuss and analyze the way to send me back. I… still feel so miserable…” As soon as she finished speaking, a few figures slowly rose from the lake of tears. They were Li Changshou, Guang Chengzi, and the others. Each of them was holding onto a silver-white chain that had been severed.</p><p>The chains trembled slightly and turned into silver light spots that returned to Little Grief. Li Changshou said, “It’s about time. Let’s begin.” The Great Daoist Master smiled bitterly and said, “We haven’t decided on how to move Little…”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A golden light flashed, and an inverted golden dipper appeared where Little Grief was, covering her. Fairy Yun Xiao waved her hand gently and the Primordial Chaos Golden Chalice flipped. Little Grief had already disappeared… “It will form its own universe and will not cause her to fall.” Yun Xiao explained briefly before the immortals regained their senses and nodded.</p><p>The Great Daoist Master waved his sleeve gently, and a Taiji Painting appeared under the Ninth Spirit’s feet. As the Yin and Yang Qi rotated, the surrounding scenery changed. They had already appeared in a corner of the Six Paths of Reincarnation.</p><p>The vicinity of the Reincarnation Disk had already been cleared. Ten Yama Lords were guarding the various directions of the Six Paths of Reincarnation Disc. A large number of messengers of death, Heavenly Soldiers, and experts of the Magi race were setting up layers of defense outside the Reincarnation Immortal Island and waiting. Li Changshou said, “Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters, don’t think that I’m being naggy. I want to remind you again. If we enter the Six Paths of Reincarnation Disc, we will lose contact with the outside world. Only the Taiji Painting can be used for us to enter and exit at will. We will strive to succeed once and follow the steps we have set. We cannot deviate from them for more than a moment.” “Okay.”</p><div><div></div></div><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2371791870283090" data-ad-slot="8264086020"></ins><script>

</script></div><p>The eight experts of the Dao Sect agreed in unison. Great Daoist Master Xuan Du raised his right hand, and the image of the Taiji Painting appeared in his palm. A black and white vortex appeared on the stone wall in front of him.</p><p>The nine of them jumped up and turned into nine streams of light that flew into the vortex!</p><p>Wisps of cold aura were about to overflow from the vortex, but the afterimage of the Taiji Painting flickered. The vortex immediately collapsed and returned to nothingness, leaving only the smooth stone wall…</p><p>After entering the Six Paths of Reincarnation, the nine immortals traveled to their destination, which was the fog at the edge of the Small World.</p><p>Li Changshou had just stabilized his footsteps when Fairy Yun Xiao, the Great Daoist Master, and Zhao Gongming approached him from three different directions.</p><p>Li Changshou was rendered speechless. Alright, among the nine immortals of the Dao Sect, his cultivation level was the weakest. “What a strong hatred,” whispered Guang Chengzi. The immortals nodded in unison. They each picked up their numinous treasures and rushed out of the</p><p>fog.</p><p>The boundless sand sea that Li Changshou had seen the last time had mostly turned into lava. The boiling lava kept surging, flowing, and solidifying. The Small World looked like it was facing its end. In the middle of the Small World, the incomparably huge lava giant kept waving its hands and throwing burning boulders…</p><p>On the top of the giant’s head, the incarnation of “evil” sat diagonally on the throne. It was dressed in a blood-red battle dress and a short shirt that only reached its waist. It explained the principle of the lesser it wore, the higher its defense. Actually, that was just the attire that the ancient female Magi often wore. The nine immortals rose into the sky on a cloud and rushed over.</p><p>“Tsk.” The “evil” girl sneered. Her voice came from afar. “I thought you guys had gone to do something. You actually went to call for help.” The Great Daoist Master gestured for him to stop. He rode a cloud forward and placed his hands behind his back. He smiled and said, “Fellow Daoist, the outcome of our battle has yet to be decided. Why should I seek help?”</p><p>“Very good.” The little “evil” girl licked her lips with the tip of her tongue. A faint black aura seeped out from her body. “I’ll kill you first before…” “Why don’t we play a simple game?” The Great Daoist Master smiled gently and said warmly, “Look, I’ll take out some good intentions. You take out some evil intentions and let them…”</p><p>Huff…</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A huge rock that was like a mountain flew over and sent the Great Daoist Master flying. The entire time, it did not hesitate at all. Li Changshou and the other immortals could not help but… cover their eyes with their hands.</p><p>They couldn’t bear to watch it.</p><p>“Who’s playing tricks with you!?!” The corners of the little “evil” girl’s mouth twitched. Just as she was about to control the lava giant to chase after the Great Daoist Master, the huge rock that had flown to the sky exploded and shattered into powder. Li Changshou suddenly felt a familiar yet unfamiliar pressure.</p><p>Why is it familiar?</p><p>The pressure came from the Eldest Senior Brother of Ren School whom Li Changshou was familiar with. He was naturally very familiar with the first backer whom he cozied up to. However, this unfamiliar feeling…</p><p>was because it was the first time that the Great Daoist Master had revealed such a level of Dao Realm pressure! The corners of the “evil” woman’s mouth curled up slightly. Her eyes were filled with smugness. The lava giant beneath her trembled a few times. Arms protruded from her back and she threw huge rocks at the Great Daoist Master!</p><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2371791870283090" data-ad-slot="8264086020"></ins><script>

</script></div><p>“Hmph!”</p><p>With a cold snort, the Great Daoist Master puffed up his wide-sleeved Daoist robe. He raised his left foot and immediately landed heavily. A wisp of black and white Dao runes surged out like a tide.</p><p>The wind and waves in the world suddenly stopped. The huge rocks that were flying under the starry sky shattered at the same time!</p><p>“Rascal!”</p><p>The “evil” woman cursed angrily and revealed a ferocious expression. The entire world seemed to have fallen into a dark shadow. The incomparably huge lava giant stomped on the ground and jumped up with lava splashing everywhere! The Great Daoist Master’s left arm was wrapped by two balls of Yin and Yang Qi. After being separated by an unknown distance, he opened his five fingers and slowly pushed out his palm. From the Great Daoist Master’s palm to the front of the lava giant, black and white Taiji diagrams condensed at the same time. The Taiji diagrams that were arranged in parallel were of various sizes. The last Taiji diagram actually covered the lava giant’s entire body…</p><p>The little “evil” woman screamed sharply. The lava giant let out a deep roar, but the Great Daoist Master was not slow. He rotated his left palm gently and pushed it forward another half an inch.</p><p>The black and white Taiji diagrams were triggered at the same time. The last Taiji diagram rotated slightly. The incomparably huge lava giant stopped and collapsed in an instant. It turned into shattered rocks that filled the sky and floated strangely in the air…</p><p>The “evil” woman was clearly at a loss. Two wisps of Yin-Yang Qi had appeared behind her at some point in time and condensed into the image of a Taiji Painting… Before she could react, the Yin and Yang Qi trapped her again and pulled her onto the Taiji Painting. Just like how she was easily restrained by the Great Daoist Master previously…</p><p>The gloomy and cold feeling in the world dissipated by more than half. The starry sky appeared again. The Great Daoist Master strolled among the huge rocks that filled the sky with his hands behind his back. In just a few steps, he arrived in front of the “evil” woman and smiled warmly. He flipped his right hand and the “friendly” ball of light…</p><p>It was still there…</p><p>“Come,” the Great Daoist Master said warmly. “Give me some of your evil thoughts. I’ll show you a very deep trick. One point is enough.” He said coldly, “Get lost!”</p><p>“It’s really interesting to cooperate.”</p><p>“Psht!”</p><p>The Great Daoist Master was speechless. In the distance, Li Changshou looked up at the sky and sighed. Then, he looked at the seven experts from the Dao Sect who had complicated expressions and said seriously, “Senior Brother, you have bought another ten minutes. You restrained the incarnation of Evil earlier than expected. Everyone, Fairy Yun Xiao and I will help the Goddess release her other incarnations. Please wait for the opportunity!” The immortals agreed and held their breaths. Li Changshou made an inviting gesture to Fairy Yun Xiao. The two of them looked at each other and smiled. They turned into streams of light and flew thousands of kilometers away from the “evil” woman.</p><p>Yun Xiao held the Primordial Chaos Golden Chalice and slowly released Little Grief.</p><p>The sound of water flowed, and the lava ground below quickly solidified, turning into a small silver lake. Little Grief sat quietly in the middle of the lake, curled up her legs, hugged her knees, and sobbed softly.</p><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2371791870283090" data-ad-slot="8264086020"></ins><script>

</script></div><p>A series of whimpers sounded in the sky… Fairy Yun Xiao stood in the air and swept her slender fingers gently. Pink petals scattered in the air. Li Changshou stood beside Xiao Ai, and paper effigies flew out of his sleeve. A few paper effigies picked up their weapons and jumped around Xiao Ai, letting out cries. A few paper effigies turned into fairy musicians dressed in palace attire and began to play a lively tune.</p><p>After waiting for a while, Xiao Ai tilted her head and looked at the fighting scenes of the paper effigies. She was a little lost in thought. Li Changshou said warmly, “The black cloth is gone.” Little Grief subconsciously hugged the pearl in her arms tightly, but the black cloth on it was slowly dissipating She closed her eyes tightly and did not dare to look at the situation inside. Only when the golden rays passed through her thin eyelids did she carefully open her eyes and observe the situation in the pearl. Little streams of light flew out and turned into a happy smile in Xiao Ai’s eyes. She smiled, laughed, looked back, and was shy.</p><p>“It’s really a pleasure…”</p><p>Little Grief pursed her lips and muttered softly. She could not help but smile. Li Changshou pointed his finger from the side and apologized. His fingertip landed gently on Xiao Ai’s forehead. A strange Dao rune appeared around them. The ground shook gently, and starlight shone brightly in the starry sky. Four pillars of light suddenly appeared in the world, illuminating the entire world. Thousands of kilometers away, Guang Chengzi shouted softly, “He has appeared!” The immortals were about to move forward when they suddenly heard a coquettish laugh. A ball of pink smoke floated around them, and the six Dao Sect experts frowned. “I’ll deal with it.”</p><p>Perfected Yu Ding took two steps forward. His ordinary face was filled with solemnity. He held up his jade cauldron with his right hand, and rays of light shone from it. Guang Chengzi, Daoist Duobao, Goddess Jinling, Zhao Gongming, and Perfected Taiyi turned into streams of light and rushed towards the pillar of light in the sky. The incarnation of “desire” immediately wanted to cause trouble. Perfected Jade Tripod shouted softly, and sutras sounded around him. The pink smoke was forced to gather and condense into the beautiful figure of the incarnation of “desire”.</p><p>Perfected Yu Ding raised the jade tripod and said, “Fellow Daoist, please fight me first.”</p><p>“You?”</p><p>The incarnation of “desire” pursed her lips and looked around calmly.</p><p>“It seems that you have come prepared today. You really want to kill us. To think that I had given you mercy previously and thought that killing you would be meaningless. However, today… What do you want?”</p><p>The breeze rippled, and the incarnation of “desire” strangely disappeared. Perfected Yu Ding said slowly, “Freedom and harmony.” The jade tripod shone brightly as the incarnation of desire appeared again! She was right in front of Perfected Yu Ding. Her slender fingers were only three inches away from Perfected Yu Ding, but she could not move any further…</p><p>The incarnation of “desire” was clearly stunned. “You can block me?”</p><p>“The disassembling of the seven emotions is nothing more than the mental seal. The six desires point towards the heart.”</p><p>Perfected Yu Ding slowly closed his eyes. The chanting of sutras sounded around him. The jade tripod appeared above the head of the incarnation of desire. It shone with jade light and trapped her in place.</p><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2371791870283090" data-ad-slot="8264086020"></ins><script>

</script></div><p>“This tripod is my Dao heart.”</p><p>Buzz…</p><p>The jade tripod trembled slightly. The incarnation of “desire” hugged her forehead with both hands and squatted down in pain. She was slowly being suppressed! Li Changshou, who had witnessed that scene from thousands of kilometers away, experienced it slightly. The Dao of Desire that Perfected Yu Ding had cultivated was actually difficult to cultivate. It was no wonder that Guang Chengzi had brought him here. To the incarnation of “desire”, that was the true heavenly suppression! The hidden danger that he was most worried about dissipated. Li Changshou retracted his attention and looked down. He hugged the pearl and sobbed. “It’s fine.”</p><p>“How dare you treat me like this… I’m so pitiful! I was even used as a Dharma artifact to release other incarnations!”</p><p>Fairy Yun Xiao slowly descended from the sky and raised her hand to caress Little Grief’s forehead.</p><p>Wisps of clouds seeped out from Yun Xiao’s fingertips and wrapped around Little Grief’s body. The clouds were like soft hands, helping Little Grief massage them to calm her down. Li Changshou smiled and said, “How about I perform a play for the two of you?” At that moment, two paper effigies flew out of his sleeve and transformed into two Daoists. They began to act out a story that he had previously made up… Primordial crosstalk. In order to make Little Grief happy, Li Changshou had already used his trump card to deal with Goddess Nuwa.</p><p>Yun Xiao immediately cast a mysterious spell to comfort Little Grief’s Dao heart. She used her own gentleness to comfort Little Grief’s empty heart.</p><p>He looked into the distance.</p><p>The incarnation of fear was wrapped in a ball of black gas. It was like a contradictory double.</p><p>On one hand, it was a weak and timid living being whose heart was filled with fear. On the other hand, it was a demon that was roaring continuously and trying to spread its fear to all living beings. However, she could completely integrate those two conflicting emotions.</p><p>The outer layer was an incomparably terrifying demon that was engulfed in black smoke. However, inside the demon, it was a weak and timid demon that feared everything.</p><p>Master Zhao was fearless. The Sea-Calming Divine Pearl directly stopped the incarnation of fear, which was not very powerful. Zhao Gongming dispersed the black aura and approached the incarnation of “fear”. He took out the “Dharma treasure” that Li Changshou had given him.</p><p>“Close your eyes!” Master Zhao shouted coldly. The incarnation of “fear” closed her eyes subconsciously but immediately opened them again… “Ah!”</p><p>The immortal with a beard and armor in front of him had turned into a ferocious ghost!</p><p>The incarnation of fear cried and almost fainted…</p><p>Master Zhao took off his mask and chuckled. He muttered, “Brother, you’re right. This is the easiest to deal with.”</p><p>Then, he began to prepare the other masks. At the same time, Perfected Primordial Unity and Guang Chengzi attacked together and suppressed the incarnation of anger in another corner.</p><p>The Heaven Seal transformed into a mountain and pressed down the golden-haired girl who looked to be no more than fourteen or fifteen years old. Only her head was revealed. Guang Chengzi said, “Go, Junior Brother Taiyi.” Perfected Taiyi asked uncertainly, “Eldest Senior Brother, are you sure you can suppress it later?” “Of course,” said Guang Chengzi with a smile. He had the demeanor of an expert. Perfected Taiyi nodded and placed his hands in his red robe sleeves before taking two steps forward. The golden-haired girl, who looked similar to the “evil” girl and Little Grief, immediately stared at Perfected Taiyi with her furious eyes. However, Perfected Taiyi only took two steps before retreating again… Guang Chengzi was puzzled. “Why did you retreat, Junior Brother?” “This incarnation is too weak.” Perfected Taiyi shook his head. “Why don’t we let her go and then deal with the other incarnations? It’s meaningless to bully this little one.”</p><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2371791870283090" data-ad-slot="8264086020"></ins><script>

</script></div><p>Guang Chengzi was speechless. “Who are you talking about?” The incarnation of “anger” questioned angrily. Golden light shone all over her body, and the Heaven Seal on her body trembled continuously. Perfected Taiyi sneered and said leisurely, “Aren’t you a little one? In the mortal world of the human race, you are just a little girl. As the incarnation of the Lady of Earth, are you really not ashamed of yourself? Look at others…”</p><p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p><p>A series of crackling sounds suddenly started spreading from all over the golden-haired girl’s body. Golden light surged around her, and jade arms appeared behind her back. The Heaven Seal was slowly pushed up!</p><p>“Who are you calling a little one!?!”</p><p>Perfected Taiyi slipped and stood behind his Eldest Senior Brother. He smiled awkwardly and said, “Don’t feel inferior. Believe in yourself. When you grow up in the future, won’t you have a Transformation Spell or something?”</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The incarnation of “anger” let out a shrill cry, and the Heaven Seal was suddenly overturned! Guang Chengzi raised his sword and charged forward, engaging in a fierce battle with the enraged incarnation!</p><p>Li Changshou, who had witnessed that scene, could not help but worry… With Perfected Taiyi’s mouth, if the members of Chan School and Jie School met, they would be able to cause a bloodbath! Li Changshou took out a bamboo stick from his sleeve. The red line on the bamboo stick was about to reach the bottom.</p><p>It was already time.</p><p>At that moment, the only problem was the Goddess of Golden Spirit.</p><p>In a distant corner of the Small World, the Goddess of Golden Spirit knelt on the sand dune and held her forehead with her slender hand. The Goddess of Golden Spirit was beautiful, cold, and delicate. She was also a personal disciple of the Grandmaster of Heaven and had many powerful numinous treasures. Normally, she would have a cold expression wherever she went. There were also rumors in the Three Realms that she did not like to laugh…</p><p>Originally, the Goddess of Golden Spirit had been invited to the Netherworld to help deal with the crisis of the Seven Emotions incarnation of the Lady of Earth. She was already prepared for a huge battle. However, in the past three days, she had been listening to the newly-emerged disciple of the Saint of Ren School, the Heavenly Courts’ Water God, explain the various details of the plan and arrange for her to practice some special spells. The Goddess of Golden Spirit gradually realized… This Water God is really stable. He can actually consider such matters and not let go of any details! This time, I seem to have come to the wrong place.</p><p>There is no fight here.</p><p>At that moment, Perfected Taiyi was being pursued by the Lady of Earth’s incarnation of “anger”. The other Dao Sect experts had already fought with the Seven Emotions incarnations. The entire plan was progressing steadily. What the Goddess of Golden Spirit had to face now were two delicate little girls… The other party’s expectant and sensible gaze…</p><p>This!</p><p>The two incarnations that she was in charge of had no intention of fighting with her. When they arrived, the two girls were already gathered together obediently. “Are you here to help us grow up quickly?”</p><p>The Goddess of Golden Spirit’s Dao heart almost melted. What should I do? What else could she do? Those were the incarnations of joy and love, the ‘good’ of the seven emotions. It was also because the two of them were too weak and the power of grief and evil was too strong that the power of the seven emotions was unbalanced, which resulted in the birth of the incarnation of the seven emotions. At that moment, they could not let sorrow, joy, evil, and love meet. Otherwise, the two little guys would be directly assimilated. The Lady of Earth would really melt into the abyss of the seven emotions and could not be saved.</p><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2371791870283090" data-ad-slot="8264086020"></ins><script>

</script></div><p>A hole appeared in the ground. Daoist Duobao jumped out and urged, “Junior Sister Jinling, how is it? It’s almost time.”</p><p>Forget it, I don’t care anymore!</p><p>The Goddess of Golden Spirit bit her lips gently. Suddenly… her hands turned into claws, and a grimace appeared on her pretty face. She looked at the two girls and let out a ferocious wail.</p><p>The two girls hugged each other and laughed together.</p><p>The Goddess of Golden Spirit kept making funny faces. The two girls convulsed with laughter and began to grow taller at the same time…</p><p>At the side, Daoist Duobao frowned as he watched that scene. He looked at the Goddess of Golden Spirit who was putting in effort to perform and felt emotional.</p><p>He did not know that his junior sister had such a side to her!</p><p>He originally thought that Junior Sister Jinling only had a Dao heart to accompany her. She had a ferocious personality that was as hard as a rock!</p><p>Unexpectedly… Ah, his junior sister had actually done that. As her senior brother, how could he stand by and do nothing!?!</p><p>“Watch carefully!”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the sky was filled with treasure light. Numinous treasures flickered around them. The two girls exclaimed in admiration.</p><p>Daoist Duobao resisted the urge to take off his Daoist robe. He leaped up and began to swim backward and butterfly in the pile of treasures. His slightly plump body kept swaying. The two girls laughed again. This time, they grew faster…</p><p>However, Goddess Jinling could not help but frown. It seemed too late. At that moment, the advancement of the two Seven Emotions incarnations was too slow. It had been less than an hour since Li Changshou had set the “Seven Emotions Resonance”! Clang! Clang!</p><p>The sound of gongs and drums?</p><p>“The Lady of Earth protects the reincarnation. That is our final destination after death. It is the beginning of our next life!” “Long live the Lady of Earth!” “Goddess Houtu lives as long as the world!”</p><p>Suddenly, the Goddess of Golden Spirit and Daoist Duobao heard a series of noisy shouts.</p><p>This is…</p><p>The two of them looked up at the same time and saw a galaxy appear in the sky. Specks of starlight floated over from the galaxy. The starlight gathered towards the two girls. Every bit of starlight contained a similar scene. In the bustling mortal city, there were people of all ages and genders cheering. Clay statues of different sizes were raised high. In front of the clay statue, young girls walked forward barefooted and scattered petals. Behind the clay statue, trumpets, drums, gongs, and clapper were playing the relaxing and cheerful melody At dawn.</p><p>In the South Continent, as long as there were temples in the Sea God Sect, the Empress Earth statues were carried to the streets…</p><p>In the past two days, the entire Sea God Sect had been fully activated. They promoted the deeds of the Lady of Earth and made the devotees of various places gather in the nearby cities to celebrate at the same time.</p><p>He congratulated her and prayed… They wished her peace and longevity… The two girls stood in the starlight and looked at each other in a daze. Little rays of light entered their bodies and the two of them slowly transformed. As the starlight continued to fall, they gradually grew up and turned into young girls. They wiped their tears and smiled happily.</p><p>The Goddess of Golden Spirit heaved a sigh of relief. She knelt on the sand dune and smiled at the scene.</p><p>Daoist Duobao laughed out loud and put away the numinous treasures that filled the sky. He looked at Li Changshou in admiration…</p><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2371791870283090" data-ad-slot="8264086020"></ins><script>

</script></div><p>Soon, the two Seven Emotions incarnations temporarily obtained the power to fight against the other incarnations.</p><p>Li Changshou looked at the bamboo strip in his palm. The red string had already touched the bottom!</p><p>It was time.</p><p>Li Changshou lowered his head and looked at Little Grief who was in front of him. He took a deep breath with the Mysterious Yellow Pagoda above his head. He leaped up and rushed into the sky with a grass ring in his palm. Li Changshou found the place where the Seven Emotions were balanced and found the place where the spiritual energy was the most gentle. He slowly took out the grass ring. The seven-colored light on the grass ring flickered continuously. Wisps of immortal light gathered under the grass ring. In front of the little evil woman, where the Taiji Painting was shining, the Great Daoist Master was trying his best to speak… “Look at this ball covered in black cloth. The good intentions and evil thoughts inside have already returned to chaos. Guess what will happen next? Chaos of emotions… Huh?”</p><p>Great Daoist Master Xuan Du paused and looked at the little “evil” woman. The latter’s eyes were filled with confusion. A light black beam flew out of her chest.</p><p>At the same time…</p><p>The incarnation of “desire” was suppressed by Perfected Yu Ding, while the incarnations of love and joy were in front of the Goddess of Golden Spirit. The incarnation of “fear” that was frightened to tears by Zhao Gongming chased after Perfected Taiyi and fought fiercely. The incarnation of “anger” that was trapped in the array formation, the incarnation of “grief” beside Fairy Yun Xiao…</p><p>A beam of light flew out from each of their chests. Their eyes were blank as they stopped moving. In the sky, the colorful beam of light flew to the bottom of the ring of grass and merged into the immortal light. An illusory figure slowly condensed. She was dressed in a plain white dress and was floating with her eyes closed… The Lady of Earth! Li Changshou bowed deeply and said loudly, “The Lady of Earth, the heavens and earth shall bear witness! Please return, the Lady of Earth!” His voice was transmitted far away, but the Lady of Earth did not react. The immortal light that bloomed from the grass ring began to dim. The Lady of Earth, who seemed to be sleeping, frowned slightly. There was a look of pain on her face.</p><p>Li Changshou looked up anxiously…</p><p>Is she not here? Is the time wrong? Or could it be that those telekinesis powers could not reach this place? He took a deep breath and bowed deeply again. “The Lady of Earth protects reincarnation. The thoughts of all living beings will never cease!” Just as he finished speaking, eight voices sounded from everywhere. It was the Great Daoist Master Xuan Du and the other experts. They bowed to the Lady of Earth and recited the sixteen words.</p><p>Suddenly, more vigorous, noisy, and loud shouts echoed in the world! The galaxy projected by the Six Paths of Reincarnation was erupting with resplendent light. Golden bubbles floated up from the galaxy and landed everywhere in the world.</p><p>Three minutes later, in the area covered by the Sea God Sect in the South Ocean’s East Ocean, countless figures knelt in front of the Lady of Earth’s statue and recited the sixteen words.</p><p>At the Heavenly Courts’ Heavenly River, Ao Yi and Bian Zhuang knelt on one knee and cupped their fists. The 100,000 soldiers behind them knelt on one knee!</p><p>In front of the Hall of Enlightenment, hundreds of Heavenly Courts officials bowed and followed behind General Dongmu.</p><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2371791870283090" data-ad-slot="8264086020"></ins><script>

</script></div><p>In the North, South, East, Middle, and Five Heavenly Gates, at the Jade Pool, the Lower Three Heavens where the Heavenly Humans lived… In the four seas, inside and outside the Dragon Palace, in the various cities of the Sea Clan…</p><p>One after another, figures knelt on one knee or bowed with a Dao salute and recited the sixteen words!</p><p>The disciples of the Immortal Du Sect, who had gathered four hours in advance, were in a similar situation as most of the Immortal Sects of the Three Schools. They were all bowing to the memorial tablets engraved with the Lady of Earth chanting and shouting… “Lady of Earth protects the reincarnation.” “The emotions of all living beings would never cease.”</p><p>In the North Continent, the Magi knelt on the ground and whimpered softly… In the Netherworld, Judge Yama, the Netherworld servants, the ghostly soldiers, and the souls that were about to enter the Rebirth Plate, knelt down and kept shouting and calling. In fact, similar situations were happening simultaneously in the trichiliocosm. Beams of golden light entered the Netherworld and rushed into the Six Paths of Reincarnation along with the golden light from the five continents!</p><p>On the spiritual mountain, a few old Daoists looked angry as they looked at the young Daoist who was sitting cross-legged beside Truth Listener. “Ksitigarbha, are you the one who gave the order for our Western Sect’s disciples to worship the Empress today?”</p><p>“Ridiculous! This is an opportunity for their Dao Sect. Aren’t you helping them obtain merit?!”</p><p>Ksitigarbha smiled helplessly. He opened his eyes and said softly, “This is Teacher’s decree.”</p><p>The old Daoists immediately shut their mouths. Ksitigarbha sighed and said, “The Six Paths of Reincarnation have nothing to do with the battle between the Dao Sect and the Western Sect. This is just to ensure that the Western Sect will have the luck to compete with the Dao Sect in the future. Senior Brothers, Ksitigarbha is cultivating for now.” After saying that, the young Daoist closed his eyes and looked a little peaceful.</p><p>The old Daoists looked at each other and left with a frown.</p><p>Truth Listener swept its tail and secretly rolled its eyes. It lay there and listened to the prayers of all living beings. It was happy and content.</p><p>In the Six Paths of Reincarnation Disc, countless golden rays filled the air. The sand and lava had already turned into rolling hills. The mountains were filled with light green grass, and white flowers were slowly blooming In the sky, the Lady of Earth’s figure was already extremely solid.</p><p>She was wearing a grass ring on her head. Her black hair cascaded down like a waterfall. Her ten fingers were interlocked and clasped in front of her chest. She knelt in the sky and muttered softly. She was giving everyone a wish. The aura around her was gentle and peaceful.</p><p>In a corner of the world, the Goddess of Golden Spirit suddenly heard a shout. “Big Sister!”</p><p>The Goddess of Golden Spirit immediately turned around, and the golden ornaments on her dress rang. The two incarnations of the seven emotions that were similar to Goddess Houtu, the love of the seven emotions and the joy of the seven emotions, were bowing to the Goddess of Golden Spirit together. They smiled and said, “Thank you.”</p><p>Jin Ling shook her head slightly and said, “Take care.”</p><p>“Yes.” They agreed softly. Their figures slowly rose into the sky and flew towards the Lady of Earth. In the sky, at the Great Daoist Master’s residence. “Just you wait!” The little evil woman gritted her teeth. “When I come out again, I will definitely shave your hair and carve a green-haired turtle on your head!”</p><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2371791870283090" data-ad-slot="8264086020"></ins><script>

</script></div><p>The Great Daoist Master smiled and shook his head. He secretly crushed the pearl in his hand and retrieved the Taiji Painting. A beam of golden light shone over and wrapped around the indignant little evil woman before slowly pulling her towards Goddess Houtu in the sky…</p><p>In another corner.</p><p>“Excuse me.”</p><p>Zhao Gongming bowed to the incarnation of “fear” in front of him. He took off his mask and smiled apologetically. The incarnation of “fear” that was already restrained by the golden light heaved a sigh of relief. It made a ferocious face at Zhao Gongming, as if it was responding to the dozens of times it had been frightened.</p><p>In another corner, the incarnation of anger, which was also restrained by the golden light, cursed at Perfected Primordial Unity below. “Just you wait! Bastard! I’ll hit you every time I see you in the future!” The bruised and swollen Perfected Taiyi smiled evilly. He lowered his head and spat out a mouthful of blood. His aura was weak.</p><p>When the nine immortals stepped into the small world, Perfected Yu Ding retracted his jade tripod and stood up to bow to the incarnation of desire. He said softly, “Sorry.” “Pui!”</p><p>When the incarnation of desire was swept away by the golden light, it cursed and said things like “monsters” and “they are all monsters”.</p><p>Then, the immortal senses of the immortals headed towards the last incarnation.</p><p>Golden rays of light descended like chains and gently helped the sad girl up.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Little Grief sighed softly. She raised her hand and wiped the tears that had not stopped falling from her eyes. She looked at Li Changshou and Fairy Yun Xiao, who were standing in front of her, and said softly, “Look, I can’t go that far. Fake is still fake. I will be corrected if I’m wrong. I’m the one who is being corrected.”</p><p>Li Changshou smiled warmly and shook his head slowly.</p><p>As she muttered, she was slowly pulled up. “Although I know that you are not doing this for me, I… Thank you for the past few days. I’m a little talkative and useless… Why am I so miserable? I knew that it was this kind of fate from the beginning. It was because you guys had some thoughts that you shouldn’t have. However, in the end, you still had to do this. You clearly knew that this was the case… I know…”</p><p>Yun Xiao bit her lips gently and turned away. Li Changshou calmly looked at Little Grief and slowly exhaled. He smiled and said, “By the way, do you have a name?”</p><p>“I… I’m just a manifestation of the seven emotions of the Empress Earth. It’s a thought of hers.”</p><p>“I’ll keep calling you Little Grief in the future.” Li Changshou suddenly said in a clear voice, “My name is Changgeng. I’m a disciple of Ren School and the Heavenly Courts’ Water God. It’s my honor to be able to get to know you and be your Daoist. We can achieve what we have today and help the Lady of Earth!”</p><p>“I-I…”</p><p>Little Grief, who had been pulled into the air, kept wiping her tears with the back of her hand. She gradually lost her voice and kept shouting, “I am the Lady of Earth. I am the Lady of Earth who is bestowed by all living beings. My name is Houtu, the Lady of Earth… To be able to get to know you and become your Dao friend… I!”</p><p>Golden light flashed, and her figure disappeared with the other six incarnations.</p><p>Li Changshou slowly took a deep breath and looked down at the pearl that had fallen in front of him. He seemed to hear that sound…</p><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2371791870283090" data-ad-slot="8264086020"></ins><script>

</script></div><p>I’m happy.</p><p>“Are you silly?”</p><p>Li Changshou picked up the pearl and said, “I tampered with it. Before you placed your sadness into this pearl, I melted it. It will always be pleasant.” A hand reached out and grabbed his arm. Li Changshou whispered, “Don’t worry. My Dao heart is very strong.” Yun Xiao agreed softly, but she did not let go of Li Changshou’s arm. In the sky, the golden light slowly dissipated. Seven different-colored pearls were circling around the Lady of Earth. Wisps of the power of the seven emotions returned to the Lady of Earth’s body and instantly neutralized each other. Suddenly, Houtu opened her eyes. The seven pearls around her exploded at the same time. The seven incarnations that could not resist appeared again. The Great Daoist Master frowned and said, “Senior Houtu, don’t…” “It’s fine.”</p><p>There was a faint glow in the Lady of Earth’s eyes. She looked at the seven incarnations that had lost most of their seven emotions and revealed a gentle smile.</p><p>She removed the straw hoop on her head and said softly, “I will bear the pain of all living beings. I will bear the grudges of all living beings. I will endure the hatred of all living beings. Why can’t I tolerate my own grief, evil, desire, joy, fear, love, and anger?” Great Daoist Master Xuan Du’s brows gradually relaxed. He smiled and said, “Senior, you can decide on your own. However, if you can’t suppress it next time, please inform me early.” “Yes, thank you.”</p><p>The Lady of Earth replied gently, her eyes filled with tenderness. Her slender fingers gently pushed the grass ring forward. The Seven Emotions incarnation transformed into streams of light and merged into the grass ring. The grass ring flew back into the Empress Earth’s arms and was held in front of her chest. “Be good in the future.”</p><div align="left">
