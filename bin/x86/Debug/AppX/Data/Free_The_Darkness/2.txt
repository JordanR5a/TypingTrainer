Rezkin stood patiently before his two masters with fifteen strikers arrayed around him. His muscles were loose but ready to coil into action at the slightest provocation. He no longer thought about Rule 24—Always be on guard or Rule 96—Always be prepared. These rules required little consideration since they were ingrained in his mind. When he was a small-man, those Rules were necessary because he did not know any better, but now that he was nineteen and close to fully grown, he realized many of the Rules were superfluous. It dawned on him that this was the entire reason for the Rules in the first place. If he adhered to all the Rules and learned all the Skills, then he would grow into a big-man at which point the Rules and Skills would simply become a part of his being. “Rezkin.” Master Jaiardun’s voice had become even more coarse and gravelly over the years. It sounded almost like he was chewing on rocks all the time. “You have learned all of the Rules such that you rarely break any, and since you passed your final Skills test last week, we have little more to teach you. You have done so well, in fact, that you completed your training at least three or four years ahead of our predications.” Master Jaiardun paused at the perplexed look on Rezkin’s face. “What is the source of your confusion?” “Master, you said I know all the Rules, but I still do not know Rules 1 and 2,” Rezkin replied. “Hmm, yes, you will learn those as well. They are your final lesson, which you will learn when you leave here,” replied Master Jaiardun. “Leave, Master? Am I not to stay here?” Rezkin asked. This was the first he had heard that he would not be staying in the fortress where he had lived his entire life. Master Jaiardun huffed, “What did you think we were doing here, Rezkin? You have learned the Rules and Skills. It is time for you to put them to use. You have a purpose, and that purpose is not here.” “I have a purpose?” he asked with surprise. Master Peider stepped forward and spoke in his usual quiet, sure voice. “We are men, Rezkin. All men need a purpose. Our purpose, and that of these strikers, has been to train you. Our purpose is now at an end. You must now go into the outworld.” “So, what is my purpose?” Rezkin asked. Curiosity was one characteristic of Rezkin’s natural personality the masters had actually encouraged. He was never punished for asking questions … unless they were something he was already supposed to know. “That, Rezkin, will become clear when you learn Rules 1 and 2,” replied Master Peider. Rezkin knew that men played different roles in the outer society. He had been trained to understand the workings of many of them. First, there were the average commoners. He was familiar with many of their Skills, but he otherwise did not know much about these people. His masters had always said they held little importance to him. Then, there were the thieves. The minor thieves held about as much importance as the average commoners, but the thieves’ guilds had been a major point of discussion. Rezkin certainly had the necessary skills for a thief, but to act as such would render much of his knowledge wasted. Rezkin thought of his other Skills and compared them with what he knew about society. He could become a soldier or guard, but most soldiers and guards would never need the majority of his Skills. None of the strikers in his own fortress were masters of all of the Skills, which had been confusing to him since they were obviously grown men. How had they grown without knowing all the Skills and Rules? What else was there? He could pass for a merchant. Although he had never been to a market, the masters had described them in detail and made certain he was knowledgeable in matters of currency and bartering. On a greater scale, he was qualified to broker trade deals between merchant houses, evaluate supply and demand, determine trade routes, and he understood (and could undermine) levies, tariffs, and taxes. The masters had even brought in a master of one of the great merchant houses, Lord Butrand, for a few years to teach him from firsthand knowledge. Lord Butrand had been a rather nervous man who sweated profusely and always seemed on edge. After Rezkin passed his Merchant Skills test, he had never seen Lord Butrand again. He briefly wondered what had happened to the man. Redirecting his thoughts to the present, he wondered how his training in poisons and battle tactics would be useful to a merchant. A noble might need any one of his Skills but would probably never actually need all of them, and from what he understood of the nobility, one had to be born into it. Rezkin had never thought much about his birth, but he was fairly certain he was not a noble. He had been thoroughly trained in court etiquette and intrigue in case he ever had to pass as a noble, but he was certain he lacked the long-term social skills necessary to endure such a position. Furthermore, no one in the fortress had ever treated him with the carefully choreographed illusion of deference that was supposedly the thing to do among nobles. Rezkin supposed he could become a spy, but anyone could be a spy. From what he understood, outworlders valued gold and power more than anything, and with promises and payment anyone could be bought. Average commoners made excellent spies because nobles rarely took notice of scullery maids and footmen. Of course, what a maid might think was important information might not be the same as what a merchant or lord would. Well, Rezkin knew he would find out soon enough. He had no more time to ponder his purpose now, so he pushed it to the back of his mind. “Masters, when will I be leaving, and will any of you be coming with me?” “There is one task you must complete before you leave, Rezkin,” Master Jaiardun solemnly stated. The master’s dark eyes bored into his own, and Rezkin realized for the first time that he was no longer looking up at the master. In fact, he might even have been looking slightly down. Master Jaiardun was a tall man at a few inches over six feet. Now, his shoulders slightly stooped with age, but he was no less imposing. His hair, once dark, had thinned so that he was completely bald on top, and grey and silver strands hung long from the sides past his shoulders. He wore the same brown short robe with grey tunic and pants that Rezkin donned every day. Today, Master Jaiardun wore a sword at his hip. Both masters were considered masters of the blade, but Jaiardun rarely carried one. In fact, several of the strikers were swordmasters. All of the strikers were required to be masters of at least one Skill, and several were masters of two or three. Strikers Farson and Adona were each masters of five Skills, which was the most of any of the strikers. Still, none of them were masters of all of the Skills like Rezkin. Rezkin had been told to come to the courtyard fully armed. It was an unusual request. Of course, Rezkin always had weapons secreted about his person unless he was told otherwise, but he was expected to know how to make anything a weapon, even mundane objects such as a comb or drying cloth. For years he had been trained in the knowledge that he was the true weapon, and he could forgo any other accouterments, needing only his own body and mind to prevail. Rezkin bowed slightly. “What would you have me do, Master?” Master Jaiardun held his gaze and said, “You will kill the strikers.” There were several gasps and shouts as the strikers leapt back. Steel sang as they drew their swords. The hairs on Rezkin’s neck pricked, and he spun to the side just as a dagger shot through the air where he had been standing. The quake of battle energy abruptly surged through him. He had to get to a more advantageous location. The masters had set him up in the worst position possible when they surrounded him with opponents. He had no idea why he was supposed to kill the strikers, and it did not matter. The masters had said it was so, and he must obey. It was a moot point, though, since now that the strikers knew his objective, they would do everything in their power to prevent him from accomplishing it. The strikers were now trying to kill him. Rezkin launched two throwing knives ahead of him at the two strikers who blocked his escape. One of the knives was deflected when the man on the right caught it with his blade, but the other sunk deeply into the shoulder of the striker on the left. Rezkin had known these men all his life. They had been his trainers and sparring partners as long as he could remember. Of course, he knew their names, but his training told him to put all personal considerations aside. The strikers were no longer men. They were targets—targets that were trying to kill him. Rezkin drew a dagger to catch the blade of the striker on the right and threw his weight into the man. As the striker fell, Rezkin grabbed the man’s face and smashed the back of his head into the cobblestones. He did not wait to see if the man was dead. Rezkin knew he would not be getting up again. Spinning around, he kicked out at the man who had been on the left and swiped his legs out from under him. When the man fell, Rezkin stabbed the striker in the throat. Jerking the blade out just as quickly, he leapt over the dying man and ran toward the next foe. A loud snap made him veer to the side as a crossbow bolt whipped by his ear. In a movement faster than thought, he launched a throwing knife at the source of the bolt and heard a strained yelp as reward. Rezkin feigned a slashing attack with the dagger, and the man he was closing in on raised his blade to deflect the attack. This left him open for what Rezkin truly intended. He dropped to the ground and skidded across the stone under the man’s guard to crash into him. As Rezkin tumbled forward, the striker flew over Rezkin’s back. It was unfortunate for the striker that the crossbowman had recovered and chose to launch his attack at that instant. The striker took a crossbow bolt to the face, but the bowman must have gotten closer because the bolt continued through the man’s head to burst free from his skull, casting blood and grey matter across the cobblestones. Three strikers had now converged on him, but one backed off when he saw what had happened to the last man who had gotten between Rezkin and the crossbowman. Hearing a shnick, Rezkin knew the crossbowman had reloaded. He counted to three and then dove to the side just as the bolt was released. The two strikers nearest him were forced to dive out of the way as well. Rezkin reached forward and grabbed one man’s ankle, dragging him closer as Rezkin clambered over him. As he reached the man’s torso, Rezkin gripped his shoulders and rolled over so that the man was on top of him. The striker’s eyes nearly popped out of his skull as a long silvery blade impaled him through the chest. Blood poured from the wound followed by more blood sputtering up through the man’s lips on his dying breath. Tossing the man aside, Rezkin kicked up into the groin of the striker who was now standing over him. The striker cringed but seemed to use the pain to power a downward strike of his sword. Rezkin kicked out with his other foot, bashing the man’s hands free from the hilt. He must have lost some of his grip on the sword with the groin impact. Rezkin clenched his abdominals and lurched up, ripping through the man’s intestines and stomach with his favorite curved dagger. At that moment a throwing dagger sliced through Rezkin’s right bicep and imbedded itself in the suffering striker’s shoulder. The young man jerked the striker around and threw him toward his rear attacker. Rezkin ran toward the nearest striker, who happened to be the crossbowman. The bowman realized too late that he would not be able to reload in time. Before he was able to draw his sword, Rezkin grabbed him, spun the man around, and impaled him through the kidney with a stiletto. The excruciating, searing pain from such an injury would be so intense that the striker’s muscles would lock up, and the man could move no more than a statue—at least, that is what Rezkin had been taught would happen. Luckily for him it worked, and Rezkin was able to hold the man in front of him while he assessed his surroundings. All of his opponents were now located in front or to the side, so he did not have to worry about his back for the moment. He was surprised and dumfounded when his eyes landed on the masters. The men who had worked together diligently his entire life to instruct and guide him so that he could grow to be a big-man, were engaged in a bitter duel, and it appeared to be to the death. Nine more. In the brief seconds Rezkin had taken to assess the situation, his attackers had launched several daggers and bolts at him, all of which were ingloriously caught by his makeshift shield. Rezkin scowled. These men should be better than this. It was such a waste of long-range weaponry to launch it without a sure shot at the target. Everyone could see he was hidden. The young man scanned the faces of the strikers and realized with disbelief that these men were terrified. They had all failed Rule 37—Separate from one’s emotions. Now, he understood. They were unable to fight like big-men because they were breaking the Rules. The solution was simple, then. He simply had to follow the Rules, and he should prevail. With grim determination, he released his grip on his shield. The man teetered before him for a few seconds before falling to the ground. It was just enough time for Rezkin to launch a series of his own attacks against the strikers. He managed to catch one man in the throat and another in the eye with his throwing knives. A third received a knife in the chest, but the man was not yet ready to give in. Rezkin ignored him for the moment and took out the man to his left while he was still surprised. Rezkin’s hands were empty when he engaged the sword-wielding striker. After a brief flurry of strikes and blows, Rezkin prevailed. He managed to get inside the man’s guard to punch the striker in the throat. Rezkin reached up and jerked the man’s head around snapping his neck. From his right, the monster of a man with the knife protruding from his chest was bearing down on Rezkin. Without looking in his direction, Rezkin lurched to the side, spun around, and grabbed the knife embedded in the striker’s chest. He drew it out with a slurch and slashed across the man’s throat. Blood surged forward, some of it spraying across Rezkin’s face, the rest pouring down the man’s chest like a crimson waterfall. Rezkin shoved the burly man out of the way. He drew his longsword with his right hand and a short sword with his left before he dove into the group of three strikers who were attempting to organize an attack against him. The strikers leapt back. Two of the strikers, Adona and Gant, were swordmasters. The third was renowned for developing a method of fighting with daggers that was unmatched—except by Rezkin, of course. He had been required to practice until he could best each of these men regularly. At times, he fought multiple strikers, and he was successful most of the time, although he did at times take injuries. None of those previous fights were to the death, though. As he gained Skills, the men were ordered not to pull their strikes. If they could score an injury or even kill him, then they should. Rezkin had never tried to kill any of these men, though. It turned out to be less difficult than he thought it would be. Once Rezkin’s full Skills were unleashed, he seemed unstoppable. He no longer had to worry about accidentally killing one of his training partners. Still, it was not his normal style in training to actually land a mortal blow to any of these men. Blades sliced through the air with deafening clashes. Rezkin met each strike and slash when necessary and dodged others. One opponent sliced high, while another struck low. When one would attempt to back away to gain room for a ranged attack, Rezkin would pull him back into the fray or dance his partners around so they stayed between him and the third assailant at all times. Like maneuvering playing pieces on the Queen’s Gambit board, Rezkin finally arranged his opponents exactly where he wanted them. With encouragement from his own blows, each one struck at him in just the right way. In one quick motion he spun, lashing both blades outward, and two heads toppled to the ground followed by their bodies, which crashed into the third from either side. Before he could recover, Rezkin ran him through. As Striker Adona fell to his knees, he looked up into Rezkin’s pale blue eyes. His voice was strangled and weak, but his words were clear. “Long live the king.” His lips curled into an ironic smile, and he laughed, which was cut short when a bubble of blood slithered out of his throat. “May he forever dwell in this darkness he has unleashed.” Adona pitched forward and breathed no more. Darkness? What darkness? And what has the king to do with this? Rezkin spun around seeking and searching, high and low. Something was wrong. One was missing. He had kept track of his opponents at all times, but one had managed to disappear while he was battling the others—Striker Farson. He was nowhere to be seen. Since Farson had apparently run away, Rezkin doubted the man would come back to face him in the open now that his comrades were dead. Rezkin hoped the striker was not secreted away somewhere waiting to take a shot at him from afar. As Rezkin surveyed the courtyard, he noted that both of the masters were also down. Master Jaiardun was obviously dead. He had been nearly cut in half from shoulder to hip. Master Peider was lying not far from him. The master struggled to breathe and suffered from a fatal gut wound. Rezkin rushed over and knelt beside him. Master Peider grabbed his arm in a firm grip on his wrist. Rezkin continued to glance around as he kept in mind that Farson was still a threat. Peider strained to deliver one last message. “You … are the only one … the only one now who knows of you … except …” His words were garbled and clipped as Master Peider coughed up blood. Rezkin could not understand what he said, but perhaps the old man knew that Farson had survived. Peider’s grip on Rezkin tightened as if it was all he could do to cling to life. “Rule 2—kill with … conscience.” The coughing and wheezing made his words come out in fits. Master Peider’s head spun in a vortex of ever encroaching darkness as he tried to remember what he had been saying. Yes, kill without conscience. He continued, “Rule … 1—Protect and … honor … your … k—” His words were cut off by another round of coughing. King! Say it! Peider thought to himself. His world spun, and suddenly Peider was surrounded by people from long, long past. He was a young boy. Other boys were all around him. He was laughing, and they were laughing with him. Benson and Teyry were there. It had been so long. You are all here! He smiled, All of my … and somewhere far, far away in the waking world he said, “Friends.” Rezkin frowned as Peider released his last breath. Friends? What are friends? It was not that he had never heard the word. Peider and Jaiardun had taught him about many relationships between men. There were partners, associates, allies, comrades, peers, lieges, and vassals, to name a few. A contract between and man and a woman was called marriage, which resulted in the titles of Husband and Wife. All of these relationships tended to be based on some written or oral contract of mutual interest. A few, such as those pertaining to slaves and indentured servants, were decidedly one-sided. Then, there were the familial relationships of blood into which one had to be born—mothers, daughters, sisters, brothers, fathers, sons, etc. He had heard the term applied—so-and-so was a friend of so-and-so, but he never understood what the word meant or how one obtained such a status. He looked around again. Everyone he knew was dead, except for Farson, and Rezkin knew enough that he was certain an enemy was not a friend. How could he have friends if he and Farson were the only ones left who knew of him? Rezkin was more confused now than ever. Perhaps he truly was not yet ready to be a full-grown big-man. He could not even understand what Rule 1 meant, much less put it into practice. For that matter, Rule 2 did not make sense either. Kill with conscience. What, for the sake of the masters, was conscience? It did not sound like any weapon he had been trained to use. And, why would there be a Rule to use only one weapon when he had been trained to master Skills using many weapons. Rule 233 clearly stated that he was the weapon, and anything else was actually just a tool. So, maybe this conscience had something to do with him. Maybe it was a type of knowledge. Yes, that would make sense. But, where was he to gain this knowledge with the masters and strikers dead? Farson might know. The masters had been secretive about Rules 1 and 2, but it was possible that Farson had been allowed this knowledge. The only way to get Farson to talk would be to torture him. Farson certainly knew Rule 3—Reveal nothing. Any amount of torture Rezkin could inflict upon him would probably be for naught, and if Farson did talk, it was unlikely he would be truthful. How could Rezkin ever know if what he was told was accurate? No, he could not ask Farson. Rezkin wandered among the bodies to make sure they were all truly dead. This whole situation made no sense. Why did he have to kill the strikers? Why did the masters kill each other? In the end, he decided the only way to get answers would be to adhere to Rule 1—Protect and honor your friends. Now, he just had to find these friends. Perhaps he could ask them what conscience was. Surely, if they were the subjects of Rule 1, they would know. Rezkin headed back into the fortress to get some help with disposing of the bodies. The only people left would be the cook, his two assistants, and the healer’s two assistants. Peider had been the true healer in the fortress, but he kept two others who provided healing when he was busy. Upon entering the kitchen, Rezkin realized he would be getting no assistance. The cook and his two assistants were dead. Rezkin knew the healers would be dead, as well, but he went to check anyway. Once he confirmed his suspicions, he headed to the washroom. He had already concluded that he could not take the time to bury everyone since he did not know Farson’s intentions. Rezkin had never thought Farson a coward, but this disappearance was curious. He thought about it in terms he understood. Farson had failed to kill him or even engage him as far as Rezkin could remember, which would go against Rule 258—Obey your masters and 176—Finish your tasks. But, had Farson been ordered to attack him? Rezkin had been told to kill the strikers, but he did not know if they had been ordered to kill him in return. So, Farson seemed to have adhered to Rule 245—Retreat when you cannot win, in which case Farson had not broken any Rules. He had acted like a big-man by holding to the Rules and Skills, and therefore, he had prevailed by staying alive. Yes, Farson’s actions made sense now. It was as it should be. If the other strikers had remembered the Rules they would be alive too. Well, maybe some of them ... for a while. Rezkin had been ordered to kill the strikers, so he would have to hunt down the missing striker. If Farson left the fortress, which Rezkin was fairly sure he did, then the striker had gone into the outworld. Rezkin could not go to the outworld covered in blood. It would raise alarms and draw attention. He would need to clean himself and don outworld attire. He would also need money, food, and supplies. Since he had practiced these Skills over and again, he knew exactly where everything was located. As for where he would go, he would start by following Farson’s trail. Farson would not risk an open confrontation at this point, so Rezkin knew the man would keep running. It was a week’s ride to the closest village, and Farson left on foot. The fortress had three packhorses and a battle charger, but Farson would not have had time to go to the stables and obtain one, nor would he have been able to open the gates in the courtyard and make his escape. Rezkin was familiar with the battle charger from his training. There had been times when each of the strikers had used one in training scenarios, but after he passed the Skills tests, the other horses had been sold or returned whence they came. At the thought of the other strikers, he felt a sudden pang in his chest that he did not understand. He was sure he had never felt it before. Perhaps he had been injured during the battle, but he did not remember taking any hits to the chest. After bathing, Rezkin applied a healing salve and wrapped the minor flesh wound on his bicep. He stood before the costume wardrobe trying to decide his strategy. What should he wear? Should he pose as a tradesman or merchant? Posing as a noble might be difficult since he did not know where he was going and could not set up a suitable cover story. Hmm … a landless noble maybe? The third cousin of a minor lord? Rezkin shook his head. Farson was not a noble, as far as he knew, so it would do him no good to use the pretense. A trader perhaps? Not so wealthy as to attract attention but well enough to command respect. No, then people would wonder about his lack of goods, and traders did not ride battle chargers. He certainly did not want to drag the packhorses around just to satisfy the image. Farson was a warrior. It held to reason that he might seek out other warriors for protection or assistance or simply for a crowd in which to feel comfortable. Rezkin could easily play the part of a warrior. Well, it would not be a role, actually, since he was a warrior. At his age, though, according to his masters … (again he felt that tightening in his chest) … no one would believe he was an officer unless he was a noble, which brought him back to the problem of playing a noble. Rezkin could not afford to get caught up in a draft or some lords’ boundary feud, so he could not be a regular soldier. Hmm … a mercenary it was, then. Rezkin threw on a simple but well-made green tunic of fine linen and brown wool pants with a heavy leather belt. He decided to be a successful mercenary and don good quality, but not ostentatious, leather armor and heavy boots. He used a leather thong to tie his shoulder-length, slick, black hair into a queue at his nape. Lastly, he pulled a heavy, dark blue cloak about his shoulders and secured it with a decorative silver clasp embossed with a black raven. Master Jaiardun had said that all mercenaries kept loot from their exploits, so even poor mercenaries could be found wearing accessories too rich for their station. Most of it was sold to pay for drink and women, from what his master said. It sounded like a waste of money to Rezkin. Drink and women were so fluid—there one moment and gone the next—at least from what he had heard. It did not seem like a sound investment. After stuffing several changes of clothes into a bag, including one ensemble fit for a noble and one for night stealth, Rezkin headed down to the armory. Not having known what he would be doing earlier that day, he had selected weaponry used for practice. The weapons were kept sharp and in good repair, but they were not the best weapons in the armory. Since Rezkin doubted he would be coming back anytime soon, he took his time to select the best assortment available. At first, he wondered if he should collect his masters’ swords from the yard, for surely they would be the best quality, but then his eyes landed on a pair of swords that he had never before seen in the armory. There was a longsword and a short sword, a matching set similar to those he used most often. The scabbards were polished black with lacquer and unadorned. Pulling the longsword from its sheath, he was nearly blown over with the splendor. The blade was streaked with blue swirls that looked like melted topaz flowing in liquid silver, but it had an edge finer than he had ever seen. The hand-and-a-half hilt was wrapped in dark blue silk cord that matched his cloak, and the cross guard and pommel were both silver. The center of the pommel was slightly raised to a point like a teardrop. Rezkin held the blade in awe. He plucked the short sword from the rack and found it to be the same as the longsword. These were Sheyalin blades! He had never thought to see one in his life. Sheyalin had been a master swordsmith who lived and died over two hundred years prior. He had produced the most exquisite blades ever created, and no one had been able to match his technique or quality in all the years since. The silver-blue swirls were unique to the Sheyalin blades. These blades were quite literally worth a king’s ransom. All the remaining Sheyalin blades in the Kingdom of Ashai were property of the crown. As such, the blades could only be bestowed by the king, in great honor, to the recipient. Each blade was catalogued and named, and their bearers’ names were recorded much like the records of a family bloodline. It was required by law for the blades to be returned to the crown upon the bearer’s death. Ownership of the blades could never be revoked within a bearer’s lifetime, even by the king, but neither could it be passed to the bearer’s heir. It was a death sentence for any but the rightful bearer to carry a Sheyalin blade. The few remaining blades were precious, and already too many had been lost or secreted out of the kingdom. Only a swordmaster would dare to carry such a blade, anyway, for fear of drawing unwanted attention. Anyone returning the blades to the palace after the bearer’s death would receive a hefty reward. The reward was meant to encourage people to return the blades, but the unfortunate side effect was that the sword bearers were often targeted so the killers could claim the rewards for the weapons. In response to this threat, a long-dead king had issued a law stating that anyone who returned a blade and was found guilty of killing the bearer would receive the worst possible punishment. The murderer would be tortured endlessly for years without hope of death. Rezkin was suddenly wary of carrying these blades. He was not concerned about thieves, but he did not want to attract the attention of the Royal Guard or the king. Without the proper papers of ownership, any guards who recognized the blades would be required to take him before the king. If he resisted, they would kill him—or at least try. Rezkin did not want to meet the king. At least, not unless it was required of him to fulfill his mysterious purpose. He could not leave the blades here, though. He would need to hide them. Looking back at the scabbards, he noticed a small parchment tied to the one belonging to the longsword. Rezkin pulled the parchment free from the sheath. He unrolled the small note and read. Certificate of Authority By Honor of the Great King Bordran of Ashai, these two Sheyalin blades, Kingslayer the Longsword and Bladesunder the Short sword, are hereby bestowed upon Rezkin (black hair, pale blue eyes, six-feet three inches), and with them all the rightful authority of a Sword Bearer of Ashai.” Rezkin was astonished. These blades were meant for him! The certificate was signed and sealed by the late King Bordran. No date was given, and his name and description seemed to have been written by a different hand. Equally strange, no title or surname was provided. Even commoners were referred to in legal documents as Master or Mistress so-and-so. In lieu of a surname, the town of birth, current residence or the person’s occupation would be used—Master Jarin of Spokeburrow or Mistress Evana Baker, for example. Rezkin had no occupation and no idea where he was born. He assumed he was not born at the fortress since there were no women. He did not even know if the fortress had a name. Rezkin was just … Rezkin. Anyone reading these documents would have no idea how to treat him. The lack of title was legally binding, and without one, he could be a smith or the king, as far as anyone knew. After contemplating the conundrum for a few moments, Rezkin decided he understood. The masters must have arranged for him to have these weapons, and because he would not always be filling the same role or living in the same location, they simply left it blank. The fact that he owned these weapons at all was a source of confusion for him, though. There should have been additional information after his name. It should have listed some accomplishment of his or reason the king bestowed this honor upon him. The document should have explained his role or rights as a sword bearer, as the bearers of these weapons were known. Anyone carrying a Sheyalin by right had to have earned some amount of trust or recognition by the king, and therefore, should have a specified amount of authority. For example, he might be authorized to act as a magistrate or carry information sealed by the crown. Rezkin’s certificate did not specify any authority. With this type of document, however, that did not automatically imply he had no authority. It could equally mean that he had every authority. Even the king could not argue successfully for one interpretation or the other. Rezkin would have to keep this information to himself unless it became absolutely necessary to provide the documents, per Rule 123—Do not seek praise or acknowledgement and Rule 57—Remain in the shadows when possible. This latter Rule was meant both literally and figuratively, depending on the situation. Rezkin could not afford to attract undue attention to himself, lest it interfere with his purpose. After strapping the swords to his waist, he selected several daggers, a set of throwing knives, a stiletto, a boot knife, a small crossbow and quarrels, and a recurve bow and quiver of arrows. The bow he would use mostly for hunting or shooting from horseback if he must. Next, he went to the healer’s stores where all of the remedies and poisons were kept. Rezkin could make his own, but this would save him a lot of time and effort. He was not sure when he might have the time or supplies to make more. He packed away as much as he could along with bandages, suturing materials, and other healing necessities. Before heading to the kitchens for food supplies, Rezkin stopped in the masters’ office. He disabled the traps on the safe and picked the lock. He collected all the gold, silver, and copper, which was much more than was safe to carry at one time, but he would find a place to hide much of it when he had a chance. A number of bank notes and account books were also in the safe, and he stowed those in his pack as well. After collecting his food, Rezkin made his way to the stables where he saddled a horse and strapped down his pack. He also collected a bag of oats for the horse, although there would be plenty of grazing opportunities. His route should more or less follow the river if Farson was headed toward the town, which was the only place the man could go. The fortress was at the very edge of the settled part of the kingdom, and he did not imagine for an instant that Farson would suddenly decide to become a hermit and live in the wilds. No, Farson would head toward civilization in hopes of losing Rezkin among the masses. Rezkin opened the other stalls so that the horses could wander at will. Eventually, they would get hungry enough to leave the gates in search of food or water. Taking the reins, he led the battle charger out of the stables toward the gate. The tangy, sour stench of blood was heavy in the air, and the horse balked, but being a trained battle charger, he pushed forward anyway. Glancing around, Rezkin realized he could not leave things the way they were. There were seven swordmasters dead in the yard along with the other strikers who were masters of various other weapons. Their swords and weapons would be masterpieces, and it would be a terrible waste to leave them to the harsh forces of nature. Rezkin spent several moments collecting weapons and other valuables from the dead men and stored them in the armory. None of the weapons were as exquisite as his own, but he did select a few knives and a throwing ax he particularly admired for himself. He secured the armory with the double interlocking iron doors and multiple heavy master-level locks. Since most of the lockmasters in the kingdom were dead in the yard, anyone else would require a catapult to bust through the stone walls and get into the facility. He doubted Farson would come back for anything. Finally, around midmorning Rezkin was on his way. Farson had a two-hour head start, but Rezkin hoped he could catch up to him quickly since Farson was on foot. Just as Rezkin suspected, Farson’s trail led to the river heading south toward the village of Perdony. After following Farson’s tracks along the river for less than an hour, Rezkin spotted something unusual. He dismounted to examine the perturbed mud. Farson’s tracks ambled all around the site indicating he had stopped here. That was not what disturbed, Rezkin, though. It was the drag marks leading into the water. Farson had boarded a boat. It would have been a small boat, big enough to fit only three or four people, but it was more than enough to get one man down the river quickly. Rezkin felt disheartened now that he realized this was not going to be a simple track and hunt. He had no doubt Farson would use the boat to get as far away from Rezkin as he could as quickly as possible. Rezkin was going to have to hunt him through the cities and across the kingdom. A tiny voice in the back of his mind begged for attention. It wondered why he had to hunt Farson at all. Until today, everyone Rezkin had been ordered to kill had been some kind of criminal, as far as he knew. Master Jaiardun did not always tell him why he had to kill someone, but Master Peider did, and they were always terrible people. Farson though, had always struck Rezkin as an honorable and loyal man who adhered to the Rules as much as possible. In fact, all of the strikers could fit that description. Again, he felt a slight tightening in his chest when he thought of the other strikers. Rezkin shook his head. He could not afford to think like this. His master’s last order was to kill the strikers, and that was what he was supposed to do. Then why were the masters fighting each other? What if Master Jaiardun’s order was wrong? Stop it, he told himself. He could not afford to question the orders, now. Maybe, when he caught up with Farson, he could ask the man what was going on before he killed him. For the next seven days, Rezkin followed the river to Perdony without incident. During his training, he had spent quite a bit of time in the wild learning survival skills and hunting and tracking. About a half day from the village, he encountered the first signs of people in the outworld. A small cottage was set upon a clear hill covered in thick grasses. Milling across the hill were fluffy, white sheep. A barking dog ran around the sheep nipping at their heels. Rezkin had never seen such a dog before. He had learned to use dogs for hunting, but this dog did not seem to be trying to kill the sheep. At midafternoon, Rezkin got his first look at an outworlder village. It was much like what he imagined, only everything was more colorful. The homes were decorated with flowers in planters, and a few stalls where produce and other general goods were sold had been covered with bright cloth that provided shade. None of the men appeared to be armed, as far as he could tell, with the exception of a few belt knives. One man carried a hoe propped on his shoulder, but it was rusted and bent. The scruffy man was trudging toward the smithy. Rezkin suddenly yanked on the reins and pulled his charger to an abrupt halt as a small-man ran right in front of him. The small-man was chasing a round ball. As soon as he caught up with the ball, he kicked it to another small-man. Several other small-men and a few small-women were running alongside, laughing and calling out for the small-man to kick the ball to one of them. Rezkin frowned. These small-men and small-women should know better than to run in front of a battle charger. And, none of them were carrying weapons, nor did they take note of him or his weapons. They seemed completely oblivious to their surroundings. They were currently breaking at least half a dozen Rules, not the least of which were Rules 8—Know your surroundings and 24—Always be on guard. He could not see how any of these small-men and -women would live to see the next year of their lives. He watched the small-men and small-women for a few more moments, taking special care to keep the rest of his surroundings in mind. He had never seen other small-men, aside from himself in the looking glass when he was young. He had not imagined there could be so many together in one place. He could see the advantage in training them in this way, though. Learning to fight opponents of similar size would be much easier than having them fight against big-men as he had. The small-women’s garments were completely unacceptable, though. He could not see how draping one’s body in so much loose material could be beneficial. Even now, as the small-women ran, their legs were tangling in the fabric, and they had to keep their hands occupied with holding the material out of the way. If their hands were filled with clothing, how could they hope to carry a weapon? Rezkin tore his attention away from the small-men and small-women as he noted that more of the villagers had stopped their chores to stare at him. Why were they giving him their attention? He was not moving or making any threatening gestures. If anything, they should be paying attention to the movements of the small-men in case they decided to launch a surprise attack during their chaotic fury. Some of the big-men stepped in front of the big-women, apparently prepared to serve as guards should Rezkin choose to attack. He could not see any advantage in attacking these people. They did not seem threatening or hostile. If anything, they looked terrified. The hidden women must have failed to learn their Skills since they were apparently unable to protect themselves. Considering the fact that the grown women were wearing the same ridiculous garments as the small-women, it was understandable that they would have difficulty during battle even if they had the Skills. Noting that several villagers were eyeing his horse, he decided these people might think he had hostile intentions since he was the only mounted man. Rezkin swung down from the saddle, glad for the chance to stretch his legs. As he started toward one of the produce stands, an anxious middle-aged man stepped forward from the crowd. He hesitated a moment, presumably to gauge Rezkin’s reactions. Rezkin stopped and nodded to the man politely, waiting for the man to speak, as the masters had taught him. The stranger let out a pent up breath and said, “Good afternoon, sir. I am Mayor Jorge. We haven’t seen you around here before. Is there something I can do for you … sir?” Rezkin would not have guessed this man was the mayor of the village. He had been taught that mayors were of elevated station, often pompous and vain. This man looked no different than any of the other villagers in his muted, brown homespun tunic and pants. His hair was clean but disheveled, and he looked to have worked up a sweat. Rezkin held out a hand in polite greeting by commoner standards and replied, “I am Rezkin. It is a pleasure to meet you. I seek only to resupply, and then I will be on my way.” Rezkin stretched his lips into one of his practiced smiles that Master Peider insisted belonged with the pleasantries. Rezkin knew he had performed correctly when Mayor Jorge’s shoulders relaxed, and the man smiled in return as he clasped Rezkin’s hand. “Well, sir, we have some fine produce just harvested this morning. Carlon, here, is the butcher,” he explained and pointed to a man over his shoulder, “and he can get you some decent cuts of meat. Hay and oats are stored down by the smithy. Is there anything else you might be needing while you’re here?” While the man acted pleasant enough, it was obvious from the anxious stares and fidgeting of the villagers that they would prefer for Rezkin to leave the town as soon as possible. Rezkin shook his head while maintaining his smile. “No, that should be fine, thank you. Oh,” he said as though he had just remembered some minor detail, “I am looking for someone who may have traveled through here. Has anyone not of the village come around in the past week?” The mayor’s smile slipped, and his eyes darted around the gathered crowd in query. People shook their heads, and the mayor turned back to the him. “N-No, sir. Not that we know of, aside from you, that is. Should we be looking for someone?” he asked nervously, as though he thought he might be failing a test. “No, you need not be concerned. If you have not seen him then he has probably passed by,” Rezkin replied. Mayor Jorge eyed Rezkin’s swords and asked, “Is the man dangerous? Should we be concerned?” Rezkin pondered the question for only a moment before he replied, “No, I do not expect he would be any kind of threat to you good people. He is … a comrade of mine.” That tiny voice in the back of Rezkin’s mind whispered, Of course he is not a threat to the innocent villagers. He will try to kill me, he answered himself. “I see,” the mayor said, but he did not look convinced as his gaze fell once again on Rezkin’s swords. Rezkin nodded his thanks and then headed toward the produce stalls. By this time, the gathered crowd had finally attracted the attention of the oblivious small-men, and they were gawking at the massive battle charger as Rezkin bartered for his goods. The deals seemed a little too good, and the young man was once again reminded that these people wanted him gone. Upon leaving the village, Rezkin paid close attention to the bank along the river just in case Farson had left his boat in search of supplies. Rezkin might have been able to find someone in the village willing to sell him a boat, but then he would have to abandon the battle charger. There was also the possibility that Farson had left the river on the other side and headed west toward Caradon, rather than continuing south to Justain. In truth, Rezkin knew that he had probably already lost Farson for good. Rezkin decided to continue south to Justain, and if he found nothing there, he would continue all the way to the capital city of Kaibain. Farson was a striker, and while the masters and strikers had never really explained who the strikers were relative to the rest of the kingdom, Rezkin always had the impression they were, or had at one time been, soldiers. With their levels of mastery, it was likely that these particular soldiers had belonged to the king, rather than some lord’s estate. If he needed to look for the king’s soldiers, the best place to do that would be the capital. That thought made him pause. If the strikers were part of the military, did that mean there would be more strikers than the ones he knew? If so, was he supposed to kill all of the strikers or only the ones who had been at the fortress? And, if he was supposed to kill strikers and they did work for the king, did that mean he was a traitor against the crown? But, if he was a traitor against the crown, why had he been given the Sheyalin blades? Maybe Rezkin was supposed to work for the king, and the king had found out that the strikers were traitors. Perhaps it was only the small faction at the fortress that was composed of traitors. But why had the masters killed each other? And, why would the traitors help to train their own killer if they had known he was supposed to work for the king? Rezkin shook his head to clear his thoughts. He was getting ahead of himself. He did not even know for sure that the strikers actually worked for the king. It had only been an impression of military bearing on his part, and truth be told, he was not really familiar with any other style of bearing. He had learned how to discern much about a person by his or her appearance and behavior, but he had not had much opportunity to put those skills to use since he had grown up isolated from the outworld.
