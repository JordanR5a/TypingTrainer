These seven experts must have sufficient strength. Their Dao hearts cannot have too many flaws. They have to be able to resist the resonance power of the seven emotions in the Six Paths of Reincarnation…”</p><p>The Great Daoist Master lowered his head and pondered for a while. He raised his head and said, “Why don’t you go to the Tushita Palace and say that with your glib tongue, you might be able to make Teacher take action!”</p><p>Directly ask the Saint to attack…</p><p>Although Li Changshou was very tempted by that suggestion, he knew that it was just an unrealistic idea.</p><p>The Saint might attack, but he would definitely appear to help them clean up the mess after the two of them failed. Otherwise, what was the point of the Saints nurturing their disciples?</p><p>At that time, what awaited them would probably be Ling’e’s favorite reward… “Senior Brother, if Teacher wants to do it personally, why did he arrange for us to come here?”</p><p>“I’m just joking. Junior Brother, go to Jie School. I’ll go to Chan School.”</p><p>The Great Daoist Master pondered carefully and instructed, “Even if your cultivation level is lacking, you can just use your Dao heart to resist the seven emotions, especially when one’s mind cannot have any obvious flaws or obsessions. Otherwise, they will definitely take advantage of the Seven Emotions incarnations.”</p><div><div></div></div><p>Li Changshou said, “I want to invite Senior Brother Duobao, Senior Brother Gongming, and Fairy Yun Xiao to help. If everything goes smoothly, I might be able to invite the fourth… According to your knowledge, which expert from Jie School is suitable to take on this role?”</p><p>“Junior Sister Wudang and Junior Sister Jinling.” Great Daoist Master Xuan Du pondered for a while. “The Black Clouds Immortal can do that too. However, Third Aunt-Master’s attendant immortals usually don’t participate in external matters. Since I’m helping the Lady of Earth this time, it’s beneficial to the common people. It’s better to invite the personal disciples of the two Aunt-Masters.”</p><p>“Alright.” Li Changshou lowered his head and agreed. He watched as the Great Daoist Master broke through the universe and left the lake of tears.</p><p>There was no need for his main body to walk around. He hung the Pagoda Master above his head and sat cross-legged by the lake. He held the grass ring with his left hand and calmly sorted out the following steps. He was about ninety-two percent confident about that.</p><p>Due to the fact that many experts had to attack at the same time, there were too many uncontrollable factors on both sides. He was 90% confident that he could take the risk.</p><p>Why did the crying stop? Li Changshou turned around and looked at the two Yama Lords 100 feet away… “Brother, how could I have dared to attack you previously? I deserve to die. I’m weak and timid. Living is a waste of food for the clan. Ancestor is in so much pain now, but I can’t help her at all!”</p><p>“Second Brother, don’t say anymore. These are all my responsibilities. The Magi who should die the most are me, me.” Why did it change?</p><p>Li Changshou was worried that the two experts of the Magi race would really walk on the path of no return. He took action in time and sent King Qinguang and King Qinguang out of the Lake of Tears. He asked them to calm down outside first. In a while, he would need the help of two Yama Lords. That was also a crucial step. Let’s begin. He put away the grass ring and formed a seal with both hands. Li Changshou’s body emitted specks of light. Scenes appeared in his mind again. The paper effigies in the five continents woke up and flew out of their hiding place.</p><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2371791870283090" data-ad-slot="8264086020"></ins><script>

</script></div><p>He would search for immortals and spirits in the world.</p><div><div></div></div><p>In the secret chamber of the Little Qiong Peak, Li Changshou lowered his head and picked up his brush. He quickly completed the entire plan and set a fixed time — three days later, at three o’clock in the morning.</p><p>That was the most crucial point of time. As the Six Paths of Reincarnation could not be communicated in time, they had to follow the standard timeline and arrange the subsequent steps. After deciding on that node, Li Changshou immediately began to summon the Divine Envoys through the statue of the Sea God… In the Heavenly Courts’ Water God Residence, the paper effigy of the Water God rode a cloud and rushed to the Hall of Enlightenment.</p><p>In the East Ocean Dragon Palace, Li Changshou and the Dragon King of the East Ocean met in the hall that was filled with boredom.</p><p>In the Immortal Du Sect, Li Changshou went to the Immortal Du Hall and found his Sect Leader. He whispered something… At the same time, Li Changshou’s paper effigy, the water god, rode a cloud and landed on Golden Ao Island. The “Breakup Ceremony” held by Zhao Gongming had already ended. After all, they were in a hurry. There was no banquet. However, Zhao Gongming had yet to leave Golden Ao Island. He was still drinking wine in the Cave Abode of the Great Black Clouds Immortal, with a few close friends and personal disciples of Jie School. Fortunately, Daoist Duobao and the Goddess of Golden Light were also there, saving Li Changshou from the hassle of running around. Li Changshou was picked up in an earth cave.</p><p>He first bowed to the dozen immortals and did not take a seat. Instead, he looked serious and lowered his head.</p><p>“I’m going to disturb Senior Brother and Senior Sister. The Netherworld is in danger, and the Six Paths of Reincarnation are abnormal. The Lady of Earth is trapped by the seven emotions of all living beings. I was ordered by Teacher to help the Great Daoist Master. After entering the Six Paths of Reincarnation, I could not resist the power of the seven emotions. I could only retreat in a sorry state and needed the help of an expert who could resist the seven emotions resonance. I, Li Changgeng, a disciple of Ren School, hope that Senior Brother Duobao, Senior Brother Gongming, and Senior Sister Jin Ling can help the Lady of Earth overcome the ordeal.”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Zhao Gongming immediately stood up and threw his chopsticks aside. He hurriedly asked, “How’s the Lady of Earth’s condition?”</p><p>“I can still persevere at this moment.” Li Changshou paused and looked up with a bitter smile. “However, the seven emotions are suffering and I have forcefully transformed into the incarnation of the seven emotions. Every incarnation of the seven emotions is eating away at the Lady of Earth’s mind. In order to ensure the stability of the Six Paths of Reincarnation, the Lady of Earth has willingly endured the sorrows of all living beings…”</p><div><div></div></div><p>“Are the three of us enough?”</p><p>Daoist Duobao stood up. There was a tinge of dignity on his slightly plump face. “I’ll gather all my Junior Sisters and Junior Brothers to go to the Netherworld to help!”</p><p>“Senior Brother, you can’t,” Li Changshou hurriedly said. “Firstly, you can’t disclose this matter to the outside world. It’s to prevent everyone from panicking or being schemed against. Secondly, the Seven Emotions Resonance is very troublesome. When Senior Brother and I entered the Six Paths of Reincarnation, we only faced evil and desire. We can only rely on the Taiji Painting and the Mysterious Yellow Pagoda to protect ourselves. If anyone who enters the Six Paths of Reincarnation Disc has any abnormal Dao Heart, they will be taken advantage of by the incarnations of the Seven Emotions!”</p><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2371791870283090" data-ad-slot="8264086020"></ins><script>

</script></div><p>“Only the few of us can do this.” The Goddess of Golden Spirit stood up. Her golden dress rang. “We’ll talk about the rest on the way. Let’s go to the Netherworld first.”</p><p>Li Changshou bowed and said, “There’s one more thing. I want to use the power of the sect to facilitate it. Senior Brother Duobao, please take a look at this letter.”</p><p>As he spoke, Li Changshou pushed a jade token over with his immortal power. Daoist Duobao raised his hand and took it. He read it carefully and smiled.</p><p>“It’s just a small matter. Should I leave this matter to… Jinguang?”</p><p>“I’m here!”</p><p>The Goddess of Golden Light, who was at the break-up banquet, immediately stood up and agreed. She took the jade token that Daoist Duobao had pushed over. Duobao reminded, “Just do as Changgeng asked. In three days, spread the news throughout the Three Realms and all the Immortal Sects that are related to Jie School. If any of the immortal sects of Jie School do not pay their respects on time, take back the cultivation technique manuals of Jie School!</p><div><div></div></div><p>Changgeng rarely requests your help. This matter is definitely not trivial. You must not neglect it.” The Goddess of Golden Light immediately bowed and accepted the order. “Yes! Don’t worry, Eldest Senior Brother!” Li Changshou said, “The three of you, please go to the Netherworld. There will be two or three senior brothers from Chan School going to meet up later. This is just a foolproof plan.”</p><p>“Finally, there’s something that I need to gather the power of the three sects for.” Zhao Gongming sighed and bowed to the Goddess of Golden Light with a Dao salute. The latter bowed too. It could be considered that she had ended her emotional experience. Daoist Duobao opened a hole nearby and said, “Let’s go.” Then, he jumped into the hole.</p><p>When Zhao Gongming and the Goddess of Golden Spirit entered the cave one after another, Li Changshou’s paper effigy bowed to the other immortals of Jie School and hurriedly left the Black Clouds Immortal’s Cave and rushed to the Three-Immortal Island.</p><p>He naturally had to invite Goddess Yun Xiao.</p><p>In terms of mental cultivation, Yun Xiao might not be the best among the immortals of Jie School, but she was indeed the most suitable candidate that Li Changshou could think of to fight against the power of the seven emotions.</p><p>Moreover, Fairy Yun Xiao’s Primordial Chaos Golden Chalice was also a precious treasure. It might be very effective. When he arrived at the cloud above the sea again, Li Changshou felt a little guilty.</p><p>I rarely take the initiative to come to the Three-Immortal Island. This time, I’m here because I have something to ask… Yes, he was indeed too passive. However, before Li Changshou could enter the clouds outside the Three-Immortal Island, he heard a soft exclamation. A cloud slid past him. The familiar soft voice entered Li Changshou’s ears, heart, and soul, causing most of his worries to disappear. “What’s wrong? You look troubled. Did you encounter any difficulties?” The cloud quickly dissipated, revealing Fairy Yun Xiao’s figure. She stood quietly ten feet away.</p><p>The clouds rose and turned gentle. His heart was at ease.</p><p>Yun Xiao should have discovered Li Changshou’s figure. When she saw Li Changshou’s hesitation, she left the Three-Immortal Island and rushed over to meet him.</p><div><div></div></div><p>Although she was still as otherworldly and beautiful as usual, there was always a rare sense of laziness in her. She was dressed in a long robe and did not tie a ribbon around her waist. Her long hair seemed to be tied up casually with only a wooden hairpin… Li Changshou sighed softly and smiled. “I do need your help this time, but there will be no karma involved. I’m just dealing with some troublesome people.” Yun Xiao asked gently, “Is it urgent?”</p><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2371791870283090" data-ad-slot="8264086020"></ins><script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></div><p>“Not bad.”</p><p>“Then, wait for me for a while.” Yun Xiao agreed. Her beautiful figure was covered by the clouds. A moment later, she appeared again. She had already tied her long hair up and put a jade belt around her waist. Her green robe had been changed into a light blue dress.</p><p>Her black hair swayed in the wind, and her thin lips were pursed slightly. At that moment, Li Changshou realized… “You actually know how to put on light makeup? I thought that you wouldn’t care about that. Besides, regardless of whether you wear makeup or not, you are just as beautiful.”</p><p>“If I go to see you, I will have to dress up.” Yun Xiao pointed at a white cloud and said softly, “Third Sister taught me this.”</p><p>Apart from smiling foolishly, Li Changshou did not know how to answer.</p><p>Yun Xiao asked, “Where are we going? Why?”</p><p>“Oh, right. I almost forgot about the important matters.” Li Changshou’s paper effigy turned into a paper doll. “Bring this incarnation of mine to the Netherworld. Senior Brother Duobao and the others have already gone over. The Reincarnation Wheel is unwell. I’ll explain to you in detail on the way. Senior Brother Xuan Du has already gone to Chan School to invite some people to help.” Fairy Yun Xiao’s expression turned serious when she heard that. She turned into a wisp of smoke and rushed towards the Netherworld.</p><p>An hour later, in the sky above the Reincarnation Immortal Island, Fairy Yun Xiao arrived on a cloud and met up with Daoist Duobao, Zhao Gongming, and the Goddess of Golden Spirit, who had been waiting there for a long time. Fairy Yun Xiao bowed. She was the last to enter the sect among the four disciples of the Grandmaster of Heaven. However, when Yun Xiao bowed, the three Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters were in a slightly reserved state. They either cupped their hands or bowed. Only Zhao Gongming, who was the eldest brother, was more casual. His legs turned weak… He took two steps forward.</p><p>“Second Sister, you’re really here!”</p><p>Yun Xiao said seriously, “Should we wait for Senior Brother Xuan Du and the others here or go down first?” Just as she finished speaking, a faint black and white Taiji Painting appeared behind her. The Great Daoist Master’s voice sounded from it. “We’re here. It took more effort to fetch some people.”</p><p>In the Taiji Painting, the Great Daoist Master took the first step. Then, it was the middle-aged Daoist who had a golden crown on his head and was dressed in a Daoist robethe Immortal Guang Chengzi of the Jade Void Palace who had attacked the Golden Bell. Behind Guang Chengzi, it was not the South Pole Immortal and Chi Jingzi who walked out. Instead, it was a young Daoist who was dressed in a red robe and had a handsome facePerfected Taiyi, as well as Perfected Yu Ding, who was dressed in a gray Daoist robe. Guang Chengzi’s cultivation level was comparable to Duobao and Gongming. Perfected Yu Ding rarely fought with others and did not know his cultivation level.</p><p>However, Perfected Tai Yi, who had been relatively active since ancient times, was clearly much weaker than his Eldest Senior Brother…</p><p>Perfected Taiyi felt a little awkward. He bowed to his senior brothers and senior sisters and smiled. “I don’t know the details. The two senior brothers asked me and Yu Ding to come over and help out with something important, so we immediately followed them.” What he meant was that he and Perfected Yu Ding did not take the initiative to come over. If they were to delay later, Guang Chengzi and the Great Daoist Master Xuan Du would have to take the blame…</p><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2371791870283090" data-ad-slot="8264086020"></ins><script>

He bowed to the eight big shots and said, “It just so happens that I have to go and inform a few Yama Lords about the follow-up. Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters, please go to the bottom of the Eighteen Levels of Hell first. There are already two Yama Lords, King Qin Guang and King Chu Jiang, waiting below.” After saying that, Li Changshou rode a cloud and landed. The Great Daoist Master led the experts of the Chan School and Jie School towards the abyss. When they arrived at the lowest level of the Eighteen Levels of Hell, they met King Qinguang and King Chujiang, who were waiting there. Apart from the Great Daoist Master, the seven experts from the Dao Sect began to feel nervous.</p><p>At that moment, the two Yama Lords were really…</p><p>It was too tragic.</p><p>Their robes were tattered, their faces were swollen, and their bodies were covered in wounds. Their eyes were red and filled with tears. Their eyes were a little dim.</p><p>Daoist Duobao said worriedly, “Is it that serious?”</p><p>“You two Yama Lords have been affected by the Seven Emotions incarnation,” the Great Daoist Master said. “Later, you will be able to experience the power of the Seven Emotions.” The seven experts were on their guard. Fairy Yun Xiao knew the most information and was the calmest.</p><p>After removing the forty-nine restrictions, they stepped onto the edge of the lake and walked through the thick fog. They saw Li Changshou’s back as he sat in the middle of the lake.</p><p>The Great Daoist Master instructed, “Let’s go over. There is one of the seven emotions lying there, it’s grief.” The experts were extremely serious. They rode a cloud and arrived behind Li Changshou.</p><p>Li Changshou also wanted to test the seven experts’ endurance of the seven emotions.</p><p>Just as they were about to arrive, he took the initiative to speak to Little Grief, who was lying in front of him.</p><p>“Goddess, are you really not willing to get up? I have already invited all the Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters over. Even if I have to carry you, I will carry you today…”</p><p>“What can I do even if I get up? What can you do by carrying me there? Everything is ultimately just an illusion. Why do you have to struggle uselessly? That’s right. Most of the time, if you don’t work hard, you won’t know how it feels to mess things up… However, I beg you, don’t torment me. Don’t give me hope and make me despair.”</p><p>Little Grief sighed softly and tears flowed down her face. “All of you only care about the other version of me. Who cares about me? I only have my tears.”</p><p>This…</p><p>A cross-shaped tendon appeared on Li Changshou’s forehead. He forcefully endured the grief that was attacking his Dao heart and quickly thought of something to make himself happy. He could even clearly sense that when Little Grief spoke, a storm-like “grief attack” erupted in various parts of the lake. “Ah…”</p><p>When he heard a long sigh from behind, the Great Daoist Master landed beside Li Changshou. He looked up at the fog in the distance and seemed to be thinking about something Li Changshou turned his head and saw the usually expressionless Goddess Jinling wiping the corners of her eyes and quickly turning around.</p><div class="ads ads-holder ads-middle text-center"><script async="" src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2371791870283090" data-ad-slot="8264086020"></ins><script>

</script></div><p>Fairy Yun Xiao pursed her lips slightly. There was a hint of sorrow in her eyes as she looked at Xiao Ai’s figure with sympathy.</p><p>Zhao Gongming and Guang Chengzi were similar. They both looked a little sad, as if they had recalled something troubling them.</p><p>Those were all rather calm reactions…</p><p>At that moment, the calmest person was Perfected Yu Ding. He was the master of Yang Jian, whom Li Changshou had always believed to be a hidden big shot. At that moment, he looked at Xiao Ai with a gloomy gaze.</p><p>Next…</p><p>Perfected Taiyi suddenly fell to his knees. His eyes were filled with tears as he raised his head and took a deep breath. “Although I want to hold it in, my Dao is still lacking… Eldest Senior Brother, why did you bring me here to embarrass myself!?!” “Ah.” Daoist Duobao sighed softly. His slightly plump face was filled with nostalgia and deep memories.</p><p>“Duobao, how did our happiness disappear?” Li Changshou could not help but blink when he heard that…</p><p>Disappear? Weren’t you quite happy when you abandoned the concealment of your Daoist robe and undergarments and “swam” in the treasure pile?</p><div align="left">
